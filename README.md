# Deep Learning Model Compression

Implementation of some model compression techniques:
- Pruning;
- Quantization;
- Pruning (over iterations);
- Quantization (over iterations);
- Pruning -> Quantization (over Epochs);
- Pruning -> Quantization (over Iterations);
- Quantization -> Pruning (over Iterations);
